## General Overview

This year is the 60th anniversary of Christopher Newport University. For this assignment, you're going to tell a story of your life at CNU through an interactive map using [ThingLink](https://www.thinglink.com). ThingLink allows you to add media to an image (among other things) and, working with one of two maps of CNU, you will develop your own media to include in this digital storytelling assignment.

Note that you will also be responsible for writing a blog post about this assignment. Check out that [prompt](https://deanna-stover.github.io/coursesCNU/2021/engl350fall2021/blog-posts#cnu) for more details.

## Assignment Breakdown

Once you've signed into ThingLink via the invite I send to you, you'll be ready to start making your digital storytelling map!

You must have *at least* 10 interactive icons on your map, including the following:

* *At least* 3 images with titles and descriptions
* *At least* 2 different instances of audio with titles and descriptions
* *At least* 2 (short) videos with titles and descriptions
* *At least* 1 *relevant* web link (note that this could be included along with the images, audio, video, etc.) - make sure for any web links you change what the Button Text says!
* A variety of icons! You can change the style, the color, and even upload your own. And, of course, make sure the icons are placed in the appropriate place on the map

To get ready to make this map, in addition to reading a little about the history of CNU, I've cancelled class on Friday, September 24th. This is to give you time to take pictures and record sounds and videos and start adding them to your ThingLink. You can, of course, use media you already have--but this media should be original to you (except for, of course, any web links).

I hope this goes without saying, but while you can certainly include media from events across campus, please do not share anything with alcohol or drugs. You're also going to embed this ThingLink in your (public) blog post, so be aware of that.

And finally, remember that you are trying to tell a story through this map. It could be about a day in your life as a CNU student, it could be about your best memories here and favorite places on campus, it could be about the ways that you struggled at CNU, but there should be some sort of narrative that ties all the pieces together.

_____

## How to Submit

Just go to "Share" in the upper right-hand corner of your screen and go to "Share Link." Post that in Scholar when you go to submit!

You'll also be embedding your ThingLink map in your blog post so that your peers will be able to see it.
