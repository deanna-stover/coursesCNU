## General Overview

This year is the 60th anniversary of Christopher Newport University. For this assignment, you're going to tell a story of your daily life at CNU through an interactive map using [ThingLink](https://www.thinglink.com). ThingLink allows you to add media to a static image (among other things) and, working with one of two maps of CNU, you will develop your own media to include in this digital storytelling map.
