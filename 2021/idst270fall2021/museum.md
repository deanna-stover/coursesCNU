## General Overview

After reading Phillip Hamilton's *Serving the Old Dominion: A History of Christopher Newport University, 1958-2011* and (if COVID allows) visiting CNU's 60 Years of Significance historical exhibition, you will propose and then complete an analog or digital project related to CNU's history or its present. Basically, we are "remixing" the museum with creative, critical making projects.

So, what is "critical making"? A term popularized by Matt Rotto, it is essentially the combination of critical thinking with making things. Although this is often digital in DH, there's been a big push to visualize data in material ways as well. Because of this, I'm allowing you to create a digital OR physical artifact. Please be as creative as you can! 

This is about taking data (broadly defined) and visualizing it in some way. Note that data doesn't have to mean numbers, but it certainly can. The point is, you're able to see (perhaps even touch!) data in some way. 

Some examples of possible analog materials (but this list is not exhaustive!)
* Embroidery and other fiber arts
* Colored pencils/paint/watercolors
* Printed photographs
* Other art installations (both big and small)

Some examples of possible digital artifacts (but this list is not exhaustive!)
* Interactive maps of CNU or Hampton Roads, maybe using [StoryMap JS](https://storymap.knightlab.com/) or [ThingLink](https://www.thinglink.com/en-us/) (note that ThingLink might be used for a myriad of interactive digital images, not just maps)
* Creative timelines, maybe using [Timeline JS](https://timeline.knightlab.com/) 
* Creative charts, maybe using [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/) or [StoryLine JS](http://storyline.knightlab.com/)
* A digital exhibit, maybe using [ArtSteps](https://www.artsteps.com/) (or something similar) or [Scene VR](https://scene.knightlab.com/)
* A 3D model, maybe using [SketchUp](https://www.sketchup.com/) or [Blender](https://www.blender.org/)
* Text analysis using something like [Voyant](https://voyant-tools.org/) 
* Graphic design - really, anything you can dream up! 

Note that I'm not experienced in all of these materials (both digital and analog), so you will have to spend some time familiarizing yourself with the technologies (both digital and analog) outside of class. However, please come talk to me if you are struggling and I will do my best to help.

## Assignment Breakdown

### Proposal - Sunday, September 19th by 11:59 pm

Your proposal should be **300 words** and explain both your topic and why visualizing that data is important. The "so what?" as it were. 

*I will not accept the other portions of this assignment until your proposal has been approved.* 

### Final Museum Project - Friday, October 8th by end of class period

There is no writing component to your project except for what is necessary to understand your data visualization. 

_____

## Late Work

I will be subtracting 5 points for every day your assignment is late unless you've been been given an extension.
