## General Overview

You'll be using [Wakelet](https://wakelet.com/) to create a media journal that catalogues our readings, in-class activities, etc. Most of what you write and produce for the Media Journal will be done during our class period, but there may be some points where I ask you to complete something outside of class. If you are unable to finish a Media Journal prompt in class, you will be responsible for completing it as homework. 

This all means that, despite the lack of an official attendance policy, you'll need to be in class to complete the activities. Except for excused absences, *there will be no make-ups of in-class prompts for the Media Journal*. 

Your Media Journal will end up being a compilation of images, links, text, and who knows what else! It should NOT just be text.

Ultimately, you will be taking your Media Journal and my feedback throughout the semester and developing a polished [Final Reflection](https://deanna-stover.github.io/coursesCNU/2021/idst270fall2021/reflection). The more detailed you are in your Media Journal, then, the more prepared you'll be for the Reflection.

## How to Submit

In Wakelet, when you're not editing (meaning, you've hit "Done"), you can find the shareable link by hitting the arrow button at the top of the page and changing visibility to "Unlisted." Once your Wakelet Media Journal is Unlisted, you should see a link and an "Export as PDF" button appear. Please download the PDF and submit that to Scholar alongside the link. To be clear, *you must submit both the PDF of your Media Journal AND the link to the Wakelet document you've created.* This way, I can look at your Wakelet online and keep your current iteration of the Media Journal for my records.
