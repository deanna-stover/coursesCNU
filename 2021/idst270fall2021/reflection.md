## General Overview

Drawing on the entire semester, you will create a polished Final Reflection using Wakelet that builds on your Media Journal and other assignments to reflect on your own work throughout the semester, the course as a whole, and the Digital Humanities (and Critical Making) more broadly. 

_____

## Assignment Breakdown

You will be writing a **1000-1250 word** reflection. When you’re done, **share your Collection** (create a shareable link you’ll post in Scholar) *and* **export to PDF** (to submit via Scholar) by our Finals time slot.

Here are some questions to get you started (but feel free to reflect on anything about the course--and use your Media Journal to guide you!):

* What does Digital Humanities mean to you now that you've taken this course? Did your definition change over time? Do you have a better understanding of the field?

* How did the readings supplement your understanding of course content (or not!)? Were any of them particularly helpful? Why or why not?

* What assignments/Media Journal prompts did you enjoy and/or struggle with? Why? Were they helpful in better understanding DH and its many complexities? Why or why not?

* Do you think you've grown as a writer? As a reader? As a student? As a digital humanist?

### What you should NOT do

* Please don't mention your grades. It's not necessary and it puts you in a vulnerable spot. Instead, you can talk about how an assignment was difficult for you or how much fun you had doing a certain project. No grades. It's just not worth it and it puts both of us in a weird position.

* Please don't quote my feedback. That's something personal between the two of us. You can, however, talk about how my feedback was helpful as you moved forward or how you felt that you needed more guidance at a particular point. 

* This isn't a rant or a time to gloat. If you had problems with the class, you can discuss *why*, but save a lot of that for your reviews of me and the course. You can be critical of readings, of course, and you can discuss frustrations, but please don't, well, *rant*. On the other hand, if you loved a particular assignment or the course as a whole, that's great (really great!), but think critically about it too. What worked for you and what didn't? 

_____

## Late Work

I will be subtracting 5 points for every day your assignment is late unless you've been been given an extension.

_____

## Evaluation Criteria

* Uses adequate **textual evidence** (direct quotations, summaries, paraphrased passages) from the readings and your Media Journal entries from the course

* **Thinks critically** about the class, individual work, and the Digital Humanities more broadly

* **Organizes ideas** -- basically, the reflection should make sense as a whole rather than as bits and pieces (this departs from the Media Journal--rather, you are developing a *narrative* about the course, rather than just completing prompts)

* Takes advantage of and **customizes** the Wakelet platform 

* Utilizes proper **mechanics**; style, sentence structure, and spelling promote coherence, clarity, and credibility

* **Cites** appropriately -- but yes, for the articles you link to directly, don't worry about citations
