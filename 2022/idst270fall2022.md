## Course Description 

*Catalog Description*: This course introduces students to the digital humanities by raising the question of what precisely constitutes this new and emerging field. Students explore how digital media and technology have transformed multiple disciplines in the humanities as well as humanities research. Theoretical questions regarding post-humanism, privacy, print culture, copyright, and more are discussed. Students produce digital artifacts related to a field of traditional humanities study.

## Learning Objectives

* Recognize and discuss Digital Humanities and its importance to cultural heritage and storytelling
* Design digital and analog artificats that incorporate critical thinking and research
* Improve ability to communicate effectively using digital media
* Develop and demonstrate comfort and adaptability with computers and technology

According to a study of US employers conducted by the American Association of Colleges and Universities, 93% of the employers surveyed agree that “a candidate’s demonstrated capacity to think critically, communicate clearly, and solve complex problems is more important than their undergraduate major.” Some of the most highly valued skills include: digital literacy, the ability to analyze and interpret data, creative thinking, and the ability to communicate through writing. This course addresses all of these topics, and will provide you with transferable skills to take into the workforce (or graduate school), no matter your major(s) or minor(s)--but do consider the DH minor if you haven't already.

## Packback

The Packback Questions platform will be used for online discussion about class readings and topics. You will be responsible for three posts (one open-ended question and two responses) ten weeks out of the semester (as marked on the course schedule). 

## Participation

In addition to Packback, you will be responsible for participating in the course proper. Your participation grade will take into account your attendance, your progress on projects as I see them during check-ins, and your more general participation (i.e. engaging in class discussion). 

## Character Sheet(s)

You will be creating a Character Sheet of yourself (think Table Top Role-Playing Game meets Class Introduction) and adding to it as the semester goes on. At the end of the semester, you will turn in a revised Character Sheet along with a Final Reflection. 

## Twine Project

You will develop a Twine Story about a social issue related to college students (see prompt for more info). We’ll learn some basic programming for this, but don’t worry! It will be fine!

## Digital Edition Project

We will be building on a digital edition of "The Yellow Wall-Paper" by Charlotte Perkins Stetson (or Gilman, as she is more commonly known) that I have been working on with students since Fall 2020.
