## Course Description 

*Catalog Description*: This course introduces students to the digital humanities by raising the question of what precisely constitutes this new and emerging field. Students explore how digital media and technology have transformed multiple disciplines in the humanities as well as humanities research. Theoretical questions regarding post-humanism, privacy, print culture, copyright, and more are discussed. Students produce digital artifacts related to a field of traditional humanities study.

## Learning Objectives

* Recognize and discuss Digital Humanities and its importance to cultural heritage and storytelling (i.e gain a basic understanding of DH and Critical Making)
* Design digital and analog artificats that incorporate critical thinking and research
* Improve ability to communicate effectively using digital media
* Develop and demonstrate comfort and adaptability with computers and technology

According to a study of US employers conducted by the American Association of Colleges and Universities, 93% of the employers surveyed agree that “a candidate’s demonstrated capacity to think critically, communicate clearly, and solve complex problems is more important than their undergraduate major.” Some of the most highly valued skills include: digital literacy, the ability to analyze and interpret data, creative thinking, and the ability to communicate through writing. This course addresses all of these topics, and will provide you with transferable skills to take into the workforce (or graduate school), no matter your major(s) or minor(s)--but do consider the DH minor if you haven't already.
