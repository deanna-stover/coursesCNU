## Character Sheet

The initial Character Sheet is meant to be a starting place where you can think about what DH is and self-evaluate your current skill levels in some relevant areas. Over the course of the semester, you will re-evaluate what skills you are learning in this course (and maybe in your other courses too!). 

There are two pages to the Character Sheet. The first page gives some general information about you and your interests.

The second page is all about evaluating (and discussing) your incoming skill level.

### Evaluation

The evaluation for this is pretty simple:

An **A** Character Sheet will be completely filled out with detailed information for each of the categories.

A **B** Character Sheet will be completely filled out with some basic information for each of the categories.

A **C** Character Sheet will be mostly filled out with some basic information in most of the categories.

A **D** Character Sheet will be partly filled out with very basic information in the categories.

An **F** will be reserved for very incomplete or missing assignments.

## Final

The Final Character Sheet and accompanying Reflection is meant to be a time to look back on the semester and think about what you learned.

There are two pages to the Character Sheet. The first page asks you to think about your definition of Digital Humanities now that the course is over. It also provides some guiding questions for writing your **300-500 word** reflection.

The second page is all about evaluating (and discussing) your skill level now that you've taken this introductory course. Please use the boxes to discuss how and why you think you have (or have not!) improved in each skill, then rate yourself on a scale of 1-10, tally up your human scores, your robot scores, and then add your Human and Robot scores together and divide by 2 to get your Cyborg score!

Remember to turn in a 300-500 word reflection as a Word or PDF file along with the completed Character Sheet!
