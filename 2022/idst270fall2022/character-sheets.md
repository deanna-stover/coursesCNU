## Character Sheet

The initial Character Sheet is meant to be a starting place where you can think about what DH is and self-evaluate your current skill levels in some relevant areas. Over the course of the semester, you will re-evaluate what skills you are learning in this course (and maybe in your other courses too!). 

There are two pages to the Character Sheet. The first page gives some general information about you and your interests.

The second page is all about evaluating (and discussing) your incoming skill level.
