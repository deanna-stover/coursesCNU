# Packback Questions

## General Overview

Participation is a requirement for this course, and the Packback Questions platform will be used for online discussion about class readings and topics. Packback Questions is an online community where you can be fearlessly curious and ask open-ended questions to build on top of what we are covering in class and relate topics to real-world applications. 

## Packback Requirements:

Your participation on Packback will count toward 10% of your overall course grade.

The 10 deadlines are spread over the course of the semester on Fridays at 11:59PM EST (see course schedule for dates). In order to receive full credit, you should submit the following per each deadline period:
 * 1 open-ended Question every week with a minimum Curiosity Score of 45, worth 33.33% of each assignment grade
 * 2 Responses every week with a minimum Curiosity Score of 45, worth 66.67% of each assignment grade

Half credit will be provided for questions and responses that do not meet the minimum curiosity score.

Please make sure you are posting *throughout* the week, not saving everything for Friday. This will help us foster rich in- and out-of-class discussions.
