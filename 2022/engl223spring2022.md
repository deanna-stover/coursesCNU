## Course Description 

*Catalog Description*: The Second-Year Writing Seminar enhances the critical reading and writing foundations introduced in English 123 and develops them with a focused exploration of literary and textual topics. Seminars center on the specialty expertise of the course instructor and emphasize research and information literacy. Students will be required to locate, analyze, synthesize, and present primary and secondary sources. Through a process of staged writing and revision, students will produce a polished research paper.

*Course Topic*: British Suffragettes. In the early twentieth century, the woman’s suffrage question reached its height in Britain. This course will explore depictions (both positive and negative) of the militant Suffragettes in media, autobiography, and fiction as we learn, read, and write about the history of the fight for the vote.

## Learning Objectives

* Practice expressing oneself orally and in writing
* Find, evaluate, and use resources to explore a topic in depth 
* Learn how to apply course materials to improve critical thinking, problem solving, and decision making
* Gain a broader understanding and appreciation of an intellectual/cultural activity

According to a study of US employers conducted by the American Association of Colleges and Universities, 93% of the employers surveyed agree that “a candidate’s demonstrated capacity to think critically, communicate clearly, and solve complex problems is more important than their undergraduate major.” Some of the most highly valued skills include: digital literacy, creative thinking, and the ability to communicate through writing. This course addresses all of these topics, and will provide you with transferable skills to take into the workforce (or graduate school), no matter your major(s) or minor(s).

# Policies

## A Note on Covid-19 and Attendance:

I want you to be in class, but I also understand that COVID-19 and everything that goes along with it (mental health, for one) are going to make this semester especially difficult. And, of course, life goes on so there is always the possibility of 2022 sending even more curve balls our way. Because of this, I won't have an attendance policy, *but* (and this is a big BUT), if you aren't present two class days in a row, I will be checking in on you. I want to know you're okay.

And, while there's no strict attendance policy, not coming to class will affect your grade. We'll be discussing important topics in class and going over assignments as well as completing in-class prompts, so without coming to class, you will struggle. This is all to say, *please* come to class if you can. However, if you feel ill in any way, it is imperative that you stay home. Please don't put your classmates or me at risk. 

## Technology:

You should expect to spend time out of class familiarizing yourself with new technologies and software. I also encourage the *productive* use of technology in class, but please don't distract yourself or others. 

## Late Work:

For each day an assignment is late, I will be subtracting five points. That said, if you need an extension, please do reach out to me before the deadline! Life gets complicated sometimes, especially right now. I'm happy to work with you! Just make sure you're talking to me *before* things are due.

## Safety Protocols Specific to COVID-19 and Academic Instruction:

Offering in-person instruction on campus requires everyone to take individual responsibility for reducing the risk of exposure for all campus community members both inside and outside the classroom. Irresponsible behavior jeopardizes not only your own health, but also that of your fellow students, friends, professors and advisors, and members of our staff. Therefore, you are expected to learn and diligently follow the safety protocols required by the University at all times. The following protocols apply specifically to instructional spaces and academic buildings.

Prior to leaving their residence hall room or home, students should:
*	conduct daily health screenings; and 
*	pack CDC-approved face covering(s) 

Students cannot enter instructional spaces or academic buildings if they: 
*	are experiencing symptoms of any illness, regardless of whether they believe the illness to be COVID-19;
*	are in isolation while waiting for COVID–19 test results; 
*	have been directed to quarantine by a University or health department official; or
*	have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and have not been approved to return to campus by a healthcare provider.

All students must comply with safety protocols established by the university while inside instructional spaces, common areas, and offices. These protocols are subject to change, but as of 16 August 2021 include: 

*	attend only the classes and sections in which they are officially enrolled;
*	sit in their assigned seats or work at their assigned stations every class period;
*	wear a CDC approved face covering at all times\* (face coverings should cover the nose and mouth, be secured under the chin, and fit snugly against the sides of the face);
*	use additional personal protective equipment as required for specific classes;
*	refrain from sharing personal materials, such as pens, textbooks, etc., with others; 
*	follow all directional signs; and
*	follow directives regarding office hours and advising appointments.

*\*Students who have received an exemption from the face covering requirement for health reasons must present the proof of the exemption provided by the Office of Student Affairs to the instructor upon entering the instructional space.*  

Because non-compliance potentially endangers others, faculty members:
*	are authorized to instruct anyone in non-compliance with safety protocols to correct the non-compliance or immediately leave the instructional space; and
*	may submit referrals to CHECS to report non-compliance with safety protocols.

Faculty members may submit referrals through the Captain’s Care Program to report absences as a way of identifying students who may have become ill. It would be appropriate to do so when students have not attended class or communicated with the faculty member in any way for a period of one week or longer.
