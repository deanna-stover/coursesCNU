# General Overview

Over the next several weeks, we will be working on writing a grant that proposes a digital humanities project. You are not responsible for *completing* the actual project (that's what you're asking for money for, after all), but you are responsible for several components that flesh out the project you imagine. If you choose, you can work in teams of two for this project.

Remember, however, that you want to imagine a project that you can actually complete within the span of a semester or summer. In fact, this project is loosely based on CNU's [Independent Research Grants](https://my.cnu.edu/research/programs/). The thought here is that if you get really excited about your project, you can apply for this program and potentially get paid to create your own DH project (it comes with a $1,500 stipend!). So, this isn't about imagining a BIG project, it's about thinking about something small and feasible within the field of DH. 

Grants are a huge part of the digital humanities field, and being able to know what goes into a grant will be helpful in many other fields as well. Plus, this is a time for creativity! This is about what *you* want to develop within the field of DH!
