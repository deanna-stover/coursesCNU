# General Overview

Over the next several weeks, we will be working on writing a grant that proposes a digital humanities project. You are not responsible for *completing* the actual project (that's what you're asking for money for, after all), but you are responsible for several components that flesh out the project you imagine. If you choose, you can work in teams of two for this project.

Remember, however, that you want to imagine a project that you can actually complete within the span of a semester or summer. In fact, this project is loosely based on CNU's [Independent Research Grants](https://my.cnu.edu/research/programs/). The thought here is that if you get really excited about your project, you can apply for this program and potentially get paid to create your own DH project (it comes with a $1,500 stipend!). So, this isn't about imagining a BIG project, it's about thinking about something small and feasible within the field of DH. 

Grants are a huge part of the digital humanities field, and being able to know what goes into a grant will be helpful in many other fields as well. Plus, this is a time for creativity! This is about what *you* want to develop within the field of DH!

# Project Ideas

For the first part of this assignment, you're not just pitching one idea--you'll be pitching **three ideas**. When I give you feedback on this portion, I'll be trying to help you pick the best and most feasible idea. *I will not accept other portions of this grant until your project idea has been approved.*

So, essentially, you'll brainstorm a few ideas for (small!) DH projects and then pitch them to me. These ideas can incorporate your area of study and/or be inspired by communities you are a part of as long as they have humanistic (and digital!) elements. So, this can't just be a pitch for a research paper--there needs to be some sort of digital component planned (again, not executed, but planned).

Some ideas (note that this list is not exhaustive). I'll also be sharing a list of digital resources in the Shared Google Drive:
* A mapping project
* An interactive timeline
* A virtual museum exhibition
* A digital edition of a text (not just an electronic text) -- and remember, editions should deal with something out of copyright and in the public domain, and you'll want to focus on something small to start, such as a short story or a small collection of poems
* A 3D modeling or printing project (critical making in a broader sense could also work here)
* Some sort of network analysis or data visualization (looking at how actors are connected in old films, for instance, or looking at Twitter, Instagram, etc.) -- note that this is likely the most complicated in terms of the technology used
* A podcast about some aspect of DH
* A born digital creative project (this could be interactive fiction, for instance)

When you pitch your three ideas,
