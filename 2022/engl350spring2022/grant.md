# General Overview

Over the next several weeks, we will be working on writing a grant that proposes a digital humanities project. You are not responsible for *completing* the actual project (that's what you're asking for money for, after all), but you are responsible for several components that flesh out the project you imagine. If you choose, you can work in teams of two for this project.

Remember, however, that you want to imagine a project that you can actually complete within the span of a semester or summer. In fact, this project is loosely based on CNU's [Independent Research Grants](https://my.cnu.edu/research/programs/). The thought here is that if you get really excited about your project, you can apply for this program and potentially get paid to create your own DH project (it comes with a $1,500 stipend!). So, this isn't about imagining a BIG project, it's about thinking about something small and feasible within the field of DH. 

Grants are a huge part of the digital humanities field, and being able to know what goes into a grant will be helpful in many other fields as well. Plus, this is a time for creativity! This is about what *you* want to develop within the field of DH!

# Project Ideas

For the first part of this assignment, you're not just pitching one idea--you'll be pitching **three ideas**. When I give you feedback on this portion, I'll be trying to help you pick the best and most feasible idea. *I will not accept other portions of this grant until your project idea has been approved.*

So, essentially, you'll brainstorm a few ideas for (small!) DH projects and then pitch them to me. These ideas can incorporate your area of study and/or be inspired by communities you are a part of as long as they have humanistic (and digital!) elements. So, this can't just be a pitch for a research paper--there needs to be some sort of digital component planned (again, not executed, but planned).

Some ideas (note that this list is not exhaustive). I'll also be sharing a list of digital resources in the Shared Google Drive:
* A mapping project
* An interactive timeline
* A virtual museum exhibition -- think about copyright here
* A digital edition of a text (not just an electronic text) -- and remember, editions should deal with something out of copyright and in the public domain, and you'll want to focus on something small to start, such as a short story or a small collection of poems
* A 3D modeling or printing project (critical making in a broader sense could also work here)
* Some sort of network analysis or data visualization (looking at how actors are connected in old films, for instance, or looking at Twitter, Instagram, etc.) -- note that this is likely the most complicated in terms of the technology used
* A podcast about some aspect of DH
* A born digital creative project (this could be interactive fiction, for instance)

When you pitch your **three ideas**, you'll be writing a short (~100 word) description of each idea. You don't have to know exactly what software you're going to use to create your project yet (although thinking about this would be good, and sometimes technology can inspire the project as much as the project can decide what technology to use!), but try and come up with three ideas you are passionate and excited about. After all, we'll be spending over eight weeks on this portion of the class. **Please order your ideas in order of preference**, the first one being the one you'd prefer to work on the most. 

## Evaluation Criteria

* Pitches a **digital humanities** project, not a scholarly paper or something to do with another field

* Follows the **appropriate instructions** (three ideas, ~100 word description for each idea)

* Works hard to be **concise** and **avoids unnecessary jargon**

* Utilizes proper **mechanics**; style, sentence structure, and spelling promote coherence, clarity, and credibility

_____

# Annotated Bibliography

You'll be responsible for finding *at least* ten sources and writing **100-150 words per entry** explaining the central argument of the source and its relevance to your project (i.e. how you plan to use it). *At least five of these sources should be peer-reviewed articles/chapters* either about the topic you've chosen or about the kind of method you'll be using. Your other sources can include similar DH projects.

For example, say you had pitched our "Dracula's Guest" project. Some of your sources would be about TEI and best practices for creating digital editions, other sources would be literary scholarship on the story of "Dracula's Guest," and still more would be examples of inspirational digitial editions and/or DH projects that already deal with Bram Stoker and/or *Dracula* in some way. 

The Annotated Bibliography should be formatted according to **MLA** guidelines. This means it should be double-spaced, alphabatized by the last name of the authors, and formatted with a hanging indent.

## Evaluation Criteria

* Follows the **appropriate instructions** (10 sources, at least 5 of which are peer-reviewed; 100-150 words per entry; formatted according to MLA)

* Shows **critical thinking** in both the sources chosen and the description of them/their importance to your project

* Works hard to be **concise** and **avoids unnecessary jargon**

* Utilizes proper **mechanics**; style, sentence structure, and spelling promote coherence, clarity, and credibility
