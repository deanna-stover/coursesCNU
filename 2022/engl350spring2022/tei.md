# TEI Prompt

_____

**TEI due**: Sunday, February 20th by 11:59 pm <br />
**Percentage**: 5%

## General Overview

As a class, we will be encoding Bram Stoker's "Dracula's Guest."  We’ll be using TEI (Text Encoding Initiative), a set of standardized XML (eXtensible Markup Language) tags, to markup the text. 

In what follows, I attempt to break down all the tags I expect you to use, although your assigned section may or may not require all of the tags listed. There is a chance that you may come across something you think needs a tag that I have not prepared for—please reach out to me or bring it up in class. We want to be as consistent as possible, so the tags below are important. 

We’ll have plenty of class time to go over our XML, both on paper and on the computer, so please don’t worry about coding. It seems scary, but once you get the basic syntax, you’ll feel much more comfortable. I've also simplified everything. I just ask that you come to this assignment with an open mind. No coding experience is required or expected. We’re learning this together!

Please note that although the deadline is on a Sunday, you won't have access to the computers in the DH classroom (and so, the software) after Friday the 18th. So, please do finish up your code by Friday the 18th so that you can just focus on revising the blog portion of this assignment the weekend before the assignment is due.

## Step One: TEI on Paper

We'll be doing this in class. The whole goal is to get you more comfortable with the text you've been assigned (available in the Google Drive). 

The **first** thing we're going to do is annotate the Google Doc using comments. These comments will explain the features of the text, rather than trying to code right away. 

The features you should be marking in your Google Doc are:

* Page beginnings
* Paragraphs 
* Em-dashes (they aren't hyphens, they're longer)
* Quotes (note that this is only the actual material in quotation marks, not the "he said." Also note that you only want to tag quotes where someone is speaking, not where a single word or phrase--such as a title--is in quotes.)
* Any misspelled words (no need to standardize the British spelling, just note errors) - to make everything more clear, I've gone ahead and marked spelling errors for those of you have them
* Any Textual Notes we're adding to the text - I've added in markers for everything that we will be making a note for already
* Those inscriptions
* That telegram
* Addresses
* Bylines
* Any subtitles ("Preface," "Dracula's Guest")

## Step Two: TEI on the Computer

This is where things get a little scarier--but I promise it isn't that bad! 

During class, we will go over how to set up your TEI document in Oxygen XML, the software we'll be using. 

Be aware that you will have to email yourself the XML file each day that you work on the project because you might not get the same computer AND I can't guarantee your work will still be there when you come back. So, *email yourself the XML file each time you leave the classroom*.

## Resources

We will have time to work on your code in class, but if you aren't able to finish, you can come use the computers in the DH classroom when student workers are there (note that I will not be there to help and they are not trained to use this software).

The student assistants are on-duty during the following times:
* Monday, 6-10 pm
* Tuesday, 6-10 pm
* Wednesday, 4-6 pm
* Thursday, 6-10 pm
* Friday, 3-8 pm

[You can also download a 30-day free trial of Oxygen XML](https://www.oxygenxml.com/xml_editor/register.html?p=editor) onto your own computer so that you don't have to use the classroom computers. 

_____

## Evaluation Criteria

* Uses the appropriate **tags**/code consistently and correctly

* That green/red box in oXygen? It's green. Meaning, the **code is valid**

* The text you've encoded is **accurate to the transcription** (note that this includes *an attention to detail*, including spacing)

## Late Work

Unless we've talked, I will deduct 5 points for every day the assignment is late. Please don't forget about your blog post due on the same date!
