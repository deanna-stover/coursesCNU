# General Overview

Over the next few weeks, we will be working on writing an 8-9 page research paper (*at least 2,500 words*) making and defending an argument about either H. G. Wells's *Ann Veronica* or Constance Lytton's *Prisons and Prisoners*. The paper should have something to do with British Suffragettes, but your topic is largely up to you! You must use at least 5 peer-reviewed, scholarly sources (see below).

_____

# Three Ideas

For this component of the project, you need to pitch **three** ideas (or topics) for your paper to me. When I give you feedback on this portion, I'll be trying to help you pick the best and most feasible idea. *I will not accept other portions of this paper until your paper idea has been approved.*

Please note that you are NOT writing a thesis yet. You need to have done research to develop a compelling and thoughtful thesis for a research paper. So, for this part of the project, you're just pitching the *topic.* 

When you pitch your three ideas, you'll be writing a short (~100 word) explanation/description of each idea. **Please order your ideas in order of preference**, the first one being the one you'd prefer to work on the most. Your description should explain what your topic is and why you're specifically interested in investigating that idea.

When coming up with your three ideas, it might be helpful to think of what questions you have about the text you are most interested in and go from there. Remember, you want an idea that lends itself to debate, but that's still reasonable and able to be answered with textual evidence. We'll talk more about this in class. 

## Evaluation Criteria

* Follows the **appropriate instructions** (three ideas, ~100 words per idea)
* Pitches three **debatable topics** (meaning, you couldn't answer any associated questions with a "yes" or "no")
* **Thinks critically** about your ideas, both in the framing and in the description
* Your ideas show **engagement with the text**, whether that be *Ann Veronica* or *Prisons and Prisoners*
* Utilizes proper **mechanics**; style, sentence structure, and spelling promote coherence, clarity, and credibility

_____

# Annotated Bibliography

You will be responsible for finding *at least* five (5) scholarly, peer-reviewed sources related to your approved topic AND coming up with a thesis statement for your paper.

For each scholarly, peer-reviewed source, you must write a 100-150 word entry explaining the central argument of your source and it's relevance to your topic (i.e. how you plan to use it). Be specific and clear here. All citations should be completed in MLA. We'll talk about this more in class.

For your thesis, you should be focused and specific while providing a debatable and interpretive argument about either *Ann Veronica* or *Prisons and Prisoners*. We'll talk about this more in class.

## Evaluation Criteria

* Follows the **appropriate instructions** (five peer-reviewed sources with 100-150 word descriptions; thesis statement)
* The entries display **engagement with the secondary sources** and you have a **debatable and interpretive thesis**
* Citations are complete and correct according the to the **MLA** style guide
* Utilizes proper **mechanics**; style, sentence structure, and spelling promote coherence, clarity, and credibility

# First Draft

Although this is called a "First Draft," it should be a *polished* first draft, NOT a [Shitty First Draft](https://wrd.as.uky.edu/sites/default/files/1-Shitty%20First%20Drafts.pdf), although that will likely come first.

Your final draft will be at least 2,500 words, but the First Draft only needs to be *at least 1,500 words* (roughly five pages). 

Your argument (or thesis) about your approved topic should be focused and specific and you will want to clearly state your argument as well as suggest the implications of that argument. Your introduction should contextualize your topic briefly and identify your thesis. The body of your paper should then provide support and evidence for your given thesis, and the conclusion should sum everything up. 

You must use at least five scholarly, peer-reviewed sources. These can be the same as your Annotated Bibliography, but do keep my feedback on both your source choices and your thesis in mind as you draft your paper.

You paper and sources should be formatted according to MLA.

## Evaluation Criteria

* Follows the **appropriate instructions** (at least 1,500 words; uses five sources; formatted according to MLA)
* The **central argument** is clear, interesting, and debatable 
* Any claims are well-supported by **textual evidence** (which you integrate and contextualize well) and you **engage with primary AND secondary sources** throughout with **proper citations**
* All ideas are presented in a **logical and coherent manner** (i.e. your paper is well-organized and flows from idea to idea, all of which relate back to the central argument)
* Utilizes proper **mechanics**; style, sentence structure, and spelling promote coherence, clarity, and credibility

# Final Draft

The Final Draft of your paper should (again) be polished and take into account your peer feedback and my feedback on your rough draft. Your final paper should be *at least 2,500 words* (roughly 8-9 pages). 

As before: Your argument (or thesis) about your approved topic should be focused and specific and you will want to clearly state your argument as well as suggest the implications of that argument. Your introduction should contextualize your topic briefly and identify your thesis. The body of your paper should then provide support and evidence for your given thesis, and the conclusion should sum everything up. 

You must use at least five scholarly, peer-reviewed sources. These can be the same as your Annotated Bibliography/First Draft, but do keep my feedback on your first draft, source choices, and your thesis in mind as you edit and expand on your paper.

You paper and sources should be formatted according to MLA.

## Evaluation Criteria

* Follows the **appropriate instructions** (at least 2,500 words; uses five sources; formatted according to MLA)
* **Thinks critcally about both peer and instructor feedback** and edits/expands/cuts as necessary based on this feedback
* The **central argument** is clear, interesting, and debatable 
* Any claims are well-supported by **textual evidence** (which you integrate and contextualize well) and you **engage with primary AND secondary sources** throughout with **proper citations**
* All ideas are presented in a **logical and coherent manner** (i.e. your paper is well-organized and flows from idea to idea, all of which relate back to the central argument)
* Utilizes proper **mechanics**; style, sentence structure, and spelling promote coherence, clarity, and credibility
