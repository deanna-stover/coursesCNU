## General Overview:

It might be easiest to think of your project as putting together a storyboard of a trailer for a short film based on one of the four suffrage plays we read (Hatton's "Before Sunrise," Moffat's "The Maid and the Magistrate," Glover's "Miss Appleyard's Awakening," or Cholmondeley's "Votes for Men"). This means that while you don't have to film anything, you will be choosing key scenes from the play to highlight, picking out actors to play the roles, showing inspiration images for the setting, and deciding on a background song. This is supposed to be fun while also making you thinking critically about the play. More guidelines are below.

Along with this storyboard/trailer, you will be responsible for writing a short 500-700 word close reading of the play you make a trailer for. This written piece will go more in-depth into the play and give you practice analyzing literature.

Finally, you will present your trailer (not the close reading, although you may borrow some elements from that portion of the project) to the class during Week 4. This presentation should only last 3-5 minutes.

### Play Trailer

It may help you to start this project by watching some examples of film trailers. [Here's an example of a trailer for a film based on British Suffragettes (the film is aptly titled *Suffragette*).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=056FI2Pq9RY)

You can choose whether you want to use Google Slides, Prezi, Canva, PPT, or something similar to produce your storyboard/play trailer.

A few notes:
* The scenes you choose for the trailer do not have to be presented in the same order as they appear in the play itself, although they can.
* 

### Close Reading

You will write a 500-700 word close reading essay (roughly 2-3 pages) about the play you made your trailer about. Remember, you must choose one of the four plays to focus on; this assignment should not discuss multiple works.
