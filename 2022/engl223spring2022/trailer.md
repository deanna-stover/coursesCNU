## General Overview:

It might be easiest to think of your project as putting together a storyboard (or visual outline) of a trailer for a short film based on one of the four suffrage plays we read (Hatton's "Before Sunrise," Moffat's "The Maid and the Magistrate," Glover's "Miss Appleyard's Awakening," or Cholmondeley's "Votes for Men"). This means that while you don't have to film anything, you will be choosing key scenes from the play to highlight, picking out actors to play the roles, showing inspiration images for the setting, and deciding on a background song. This is supposed to be fun while also making you thinking critically about the play. More guidelines are below.

Along with this storyboard/trailer, you will be responsible for writing a short 400-600 word close reading of the play you make a trailer for. This written piece will go more in-depth into the play and give you practice analyzing literature.

Finally, you will present your trailer (not the close reading, although you may borrow some elements from that portion of the project) to the class during Week 4. This presentation should only last 3-5 minutes.

### Play Trailer

It may help you to start this project by watching some examples of film trailers. [Here's an example of a trailer for a film based on British Suffragettes (the film is aptly titled *Suffragette*).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=056FI2Pq9RY)

You can choose whether you want to use Google Slides, Prezi, Canva, PPT, or something similar to produce the storyboard for your play trailer.

Here are some guidelines for your play trailer storyboard:
* Include a title slide with the name of the play, the author, and your name.
* Include images of each of your actors (give the character name and actor's name). This can be on one slide, but explain briefly why you've chosen these actors.
* Include a slide with images of inspiration for the setting (most of these plays are set in one room, but feel free to have a few inspiration images).
* Include a link to at least one song. Note that you may imagine this song to play throughout the entire trailer or only part of it and you may have a mix of songs. Be specific about what parts of the song you'd like to use and when. You should include important lyrics if there are any. Explain briefly why you've chosen the(se) song(s).
* Decide on what the most important passages in the play are. You should include a *minimum* of five passages from the play (but it's up to you how many slides each passage/scene requires). For each passage: 
  * Include a brief description of the scene (what is happening at that moment. Again, think of this as a film trailer. Use context from the play and any relevant stage directions to help introduce the scene. Think of this as not only context for the passage, but also an introduction to how you see this passage being filmed/performed).
  * Indicate the speaker(s) if the scene is made up of dialogue and then write out the dialogue/passage you'd like to include in your trailer.
  * Include a representative image or images of the actor(s), setting, and/or relevant artifacts/costuming (inspiration for furniture, decor, clothing, etc.).
  * Indicate what music (if any) is playing in the background of each scene and remind us of any lyrics if they're relevant.
* Decide on whether there's a voiceover in the trailer and, if so, include what it might say in the appropriate slides (note that a voiceover is not required, but might be helpful)

A few notes:
* The passages you choose for the trailer do not have to be presented in the same order as they appear in the play itself, although they can.
* Link any images to their source or provide a link to image sources somewhere on the same slide. This will serve as your citation for images.
* You should be quoting from the play, but when you do, include page numbers in parentheses. So: "blah, blah, blah" (451).

### Close Reading

You will write a 400-600 word close reading essay (roughly 1.5-2 pages) about the play you made your trailer about. Remember, you must choose one of the four plays to focus on; this assignment should not discuss multiple works, so whichever play you choose to make a trailer for will be the play you write your close reading about. Think about this carefully before beginning.
