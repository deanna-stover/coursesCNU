## Course Description 

*Catalog Description*: By writing with and critically analyzing digital platforms and texts, along with the production of new media objects, students are challenged to go beyond print-based composition to explore the affordances of multimodal technologies, especially collaboration. Specific topics vary by instructor, but may include social media, blog-writing, and digital rhetorics and design.

## Learning Objectives

* Write for digital environments using a variety of platforms and develop specific skills, competencies, and points of view needed by digital humanists
* Find, evaluate, and use resources to explore a topic in depth and critique digital humanities projects
* Learn how to apply course materials to improve critical thinking, problem solving, and decision making 
* Practice expressing oneself professionally and use feedback to improve writing

According to a study of US employers conducted by the American Association of Colleges and Universities, 93% of the employers surveyed agree that “a candidate’s demonstrated capacity to think critically, communicate clearly, and solve complex problems is more important than their undergraduate major.” Some of the most highly valued skills include: digital literacy, the ability to analyze and interpret data, creative thinking, and the ability to communicate through writing. This course addresses all of these topics, and will provide you with transferable skills to take into the workforce (or graduate school), no matter your major(s) or minor(s)--but do consider the DH minor if you haven't already.
