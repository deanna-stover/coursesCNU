## General Overview

You'll be setting up an *academic* or *professional* Twitter, meaning you might need to create a new profile if you already have a personal account. If you're unfamiliar with Twitter, [check this out](https://digitalhumanities.berkeley.edu/twitter-scholarly-networking). 

You should be **posting on Twitter *twice* per week** and then **submitting Tweets to me via Scholar**.

## Evaluation Criteria

* I will grade your tweets each week as Pass/Fail based on completion. *However*, I may occasionally give some short feedback on improving your tweets. This is important because you'll be using your tweets (and maybe even tweets from other people in class or from anyone, really, but I digress) in your Final Reflection. You'll be *required* to use some of your own tweets in that reflection, so take your tweets seriously!
* I will count retweets as long as you add a *substantial* comment. 
* I will count *substantial* replies to other people's posts.
* You must **submit screenshots of your tweets/retweets/replies each week** to get credit. (See how in "Assignment Breakdown" above.)

***A bad tweet***: I really liked the reading, but I still have questions.

What reading? Why? What questions?

***A better tweet***: Kirschenbaum attempts to answer "What is the Digital Humanities?" but I'm still not sure if he actually answered the question for me.

More specific but I still have questions about your questions. Add some more detail (understanding that you only have so many characters!) 

***A good tweet***: 

Kirschenbaum attempts to answer "What is the Digital Humanities?" but I'm wondering what makes the digital humanities different than the humanities now that most things are done digitally? He was also writing ten years ago, so what has changed in the field? 

* Note that you don't always have to ask questions. You can make statements too! Or answer questions!

**An UNsubstantial comment or reply** I agree with your questions! Ten years is a long time!

**A *substantial* comment or reply** Digital Humanities is roughly 25 years old and ten years does seem like a substantial amount of time, but I think defining DH will always be hard. Technology is constantly evolving, so I'm not sure we can even really define DH in any lasting way.

**A *substantial* comment or reply to THAT reply** I disagree. I think technology is advancing, of course, but the principles are the same. As long as people are doing humanities scholarship digitally, isn't that DH? I think the blurring really comes when we ask what is humanities work to begin with?

* Note that it's fine to disagree! Be collegial, but you don't have to have the same thoughts as everyone else. It's also okay to *change* your mind over the course of the semester -- or even over the course of a day! You might even change your mind several times. That's what humanities education is for, in my opinion -- it helps us to understand how we view a thing and also how to question those same views. That's how we grow as students and people.
