## General Overview

Twitter is pretty popular in the Digital Humanities (DH) community and has been for awhile. It's also a good way of practicing being concise and informative while talking to a public audience. You'll be setting up an *academic* or *professional* Twitter, meaning you might need to create a new profile if you already have a personal account. If you're unfamiliar with Twitter, [check this out](https://digitalhumanities.berkeley.edu/twitter-scholarly-networking). 

You should be **posting on Twitter *at least twice* per week** and then **submitting Tweets to me via Scholar each Sunday by 11:59 pm**. To submit your Tweets via Scholar, you'll need to take screen shots. I've listed some resources and instructions below. I've also included instructions for sumbitting your tweets under "How to Submit."

## Assignment Breakdown

### Day One

* First thing first, you'll set up your new Twitter (if necessary). If you don't have a Twitter profile yet, go to Twitter.com and follow the instructions. If you need a second account, [follow these instructions.](https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/managing-multiple-twitter-accounts)
  * Choose a *professional* username
  * Try and keep your username under 15 characters <br />
  * Personalize your profile! But if you don't feel like adding a profile picture of yourself, that's fine. Find some kind of profile picture though.
 
* Add your full name and Twitter username to the appropriate Google Doc in our class Google Drive. Follow everyone else in the class (you may have to come back if you're one of the first few people to post). <br />

* Post your first tweet introducing yourself! You might say your major and why you're interested in DH!

### And then . . .

* Post at least two substantial (see below) tweets a week and take screenshots as you go so that you don't forget. <br />

* Submit your tweets via Scholar each Sunday by 11:59 pm.

## Evaluation Criteria

* *You must submit screenshots of your tweets/retweets/replies each week to get credit*. (See how in "How to Submit" below) <br />

* I will grade your tweets each week 
  * If you don't submit *at least two* tweets, you get a 0 for the week.
  * If you submit two tweets but they are UNsubstantial (see below), you will recieve a 5 out of 10.
  * Please tweet *throughout* the week as readings are assigned. If I only see you posting during/after class, I reserve the right to give you a 0.
  
* I will count retweets as long as you add a *substantial* comment. <br />

* I will count *substantial* replies to other people's posts.


I may occasionally give some short feedback on improving your tweets. Even if you're getting 10/10 based on completion, my advice is important because you'll be using your tweets (and maybe even tweets from other people in class or from anyone, really, but I digress) in your Final Reflection. You'll be *required* to use some of your own tweets in that reflection, so take your tweets seriously!

## Examples

**An UNsubstantial tweet**: I really liked the reading, but I still have questions.

What reading? Why? What questions?

**A better tweet**: Kirschenbaum attempts to answer "What is the Digital Humanities?" but I'm still not sure if he actually answered the question for me.

More specific but I still have questions about your questions. Add some more detail (understanding that you only have so many characters!) 

**A *substantial* tweet**: 

Kirschenbaum attempts to answer "What is the Digital Humanities?" but I'm wondering what makes the digital humanities different than the humanities now that most things are done digitally? He was also writing ten years ago, so what has changed in the field? 

* Note that you don't always have to ask questions. You can make statements too! Or answer questions!

**An UNsubstantial comment or reply** I agree with your questions! Ten years is a long time!

**A *substantial* comment or reply** Ten years does seem like a substantial amount of time, but I think defining DH will always be hard. Technology is constantly evolving, so I'm not sure we can even really define DH in any lasting way.

**A *substantial* comment or reply to THAT reply** I disagree. I think technology is advancing, of course, but the principles are the same. As long as people are doing humanities scholarship digitally, isn't that DH? I think the blurring really comes when we ask what is humanities work to begin with?

* Note that it's fine to disagree! Be collegial, but you don't have to have the same thoughts as everyone else. It's also okay to *change* your mind over the course of the semester -- or even over the course of a day! You might even change your mind several times. I might change my mind too. That's what humanities education is for in my opinion -- it helps us to understand how we view a thing and also how to question those same views. That's how we grow as students, academics, and people.
