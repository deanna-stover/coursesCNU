## General Overview

We'll be comparing the manuscript and periodical versions of "The Yellow Wall-Paper" using Juxta Commons, a collation software. You'll be responsible for transcribing a short portion of the handwritten manuscript in two different forms and then writing an essay that discusses the differences between the two texts and reflects on the experience of transcribing and preparing a text.

## Assignment Breakdown

### - Transcriptions

I will assign you a few pages of the [manuscript version of “The Yellow Wall-Paper”](http://schlesinger.radcliffe.harvard.edu/onlinecollections/gilman/search?topics[]=The%20Yellow%20Wall-Paper%20(Manuscript)&page=1) to transcribe. The list of what passage you're assigned is forthcoming. 

* ***Diplomatic Transcription** - Monday, September 28th*

  For our purposes, a diplomatic transcription means that we're including everything we see in the manuscript such as crossed-out words. The difference is, instead of using symbols or notes, you'll be trying to simulate it in Google Docs by using strikethrough, for instance, and/or by adding a comment. We'll talk more about how to do this for your specific pages in class, but [here are some tips about reading handwritten documents in the meantime.](https://www.stagestories.org/resources/reading-handwritten-archival-documents/)

  **By class** - You'll want to finish your diplomatic transcriptions by class in order to (virtually) meet with your assigned partner. The two of you will "Proofread" the document together (see [proofreading](https://gde.upress.virginia.edu/06-gde.html#h3.1)).

  **By 11:59 pm** - Now that you've double-checked your transcription with your partner and corrected any mistakes, you're done with the diplomatic transcription! Leave it in the Google Doc for now. You'll submit everything to me on Wednesday.  

* ***Clear Transcription** - Wednesday, September 30th by 11:59 pm*

  In a **new** Google Doc I will have created, you'll be editing your transcription. Juxta Commons doesn't recognize strikethrough or comments, so we'll be cleaning up our transcriptions to be the "final" version that Stetson imagined. That means implementing any and all edits she made in the manuscript. So, delete crossed out words, for instance. You'll also be resolving any comments you made, but again, this is in a new document. 

  **By 11:59 pm** - Submit *both* transcriptions via Scholar (even if they're exactly the same). You can do this by copying and pasting your portion of the transcriptions into a Word Doc and/or a separate Google Doc that you then download as a PDF or Word file. 
    * Note that you will more than likely have comments in your diplomatic transcription and that I'd like to see those so make sure they show up in the document you submit to Scholar.

### - Essay - Sunday, September 27th by 11:59 pm

Now that we've created the Juxta edition (in class), write up a **750-1000 word** essay that combines close reading and reflection. First of all, you'll want to discuss the differences you see between Stetson's manuscript and the periodical (feel free to cite Shawn St. Jean, but also think about what you notice on your own). Secondly, you'll want to reflect on the process of transcribing and preparing the manuscript.
