## General Overview

Now that we've read [Katherine Hayles's "How We Read: Close, Hyper, Machine,"](https://www.ade.mla.org/content/download/7915/225678) you are going to write a short paper (**1000-1500 words total**) performing close readings *and* reflecting on the ways reading changes depending on how we go about doing it. 

We'll be reading "The Yellow Wall-Paper" by Charlotte Perkins Gilman (or Stetson) in several different ways, writing as we go. *Although I won't be collecting your writing until **September 6th**, it is important that you complete the following by the dates given below in order to complete the project as intended -- and to keep from getting overwhelmed*.

## Assignment Breakdown

### - Close Reading - Friday, September 11th (by class)

Write a **300-500 word** close reading of *the periodical version of* ["The Yellow-Wallpaper"](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/theliteratureofprescription/exhibitionAssets/digitalDocs/The-Yellow-Wall-Paper.pdf) and post it in a Wakelet Collection. 

*Make sure you include at least one picture of any related annotations!*
 

### - Hyper Reading - Monday, Septmeber 14th (by class)

Read the Hypertext Library’s version of [“The Yellow Wallpaper.”](http://www.hypertextlibrary.com/books/yellow_wallpaper/) Play around with the text and write a **200-300 word** reflection on the activity and post it in the same Wakelet Collection as the Close Reading. 

Some questions to consider:
* Did your reading change? 
* What sticks out to you the most? 
* What was the experience of reading using hyperlinks? 

*Make sure you include at least one relevant picture!*


### - Machine Reading - Wednesday, September 16th (by class)

Use [Voyant](https://voyant-tools.org/) to “read” “The Yellow Wallpaper.” ([Here's a link to the full text--make sure you copy and paste the text and not all the metadata](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1952/1952-h/1952-h.htm)). Think about the Cirrus and Trends graphs, but also play around with the Visualizations.

If you're totally lost using Voyant, check out [this](https://voyant-tools.org/docs/#!/guide/tutorial) and [this](https://voyant-tools.org/docs/#!/guide/tools).

Write a **200-300 word** reflection on the activity and add it to the same Wakelet Collection. 

Some questions to consider:
* Did anything change your understanding of the text? 
* What sticks out to you the most? 
* What was your experience using Voyant? It's okay if you say frustrating, but explain why! 

*Make sure to include at least **two** images!* It's easiest to take screen captures rather than trying to embed anything.

### - Introduction and Conclusion - Friday, September 18th (by class)

Write an introduction and conclusion after our class discussion from Wednesday (if you missed class for any reason, you are still responsible for writing an introduction and conclusion) and post it to the same Wakelet Collection. Combined, the introduction should be **roughly 300-400 words**.

### - Final Essay due Friday, September 18th at 11:59 pm

Polish your work and add a bibliography (note that the word count should not include the bibliography). When you're done, **share your Collection** (create a shareable link you'll send to me) *and* **export to PDF** (to submit via Scholar) by 11:59 pm.

## Evaluation Criteria

* Uses adequate **textual evidence** (direct quotations, summaries, and paraphrased passages) to support any claims
  * This is especially important for the close reading, but should also be employed when Hyper and Machine reading
  
* **Thinks critically** about the reading experience instead of simply stating feelings or facts

* Includes *at least **four images*** interspersed throughout the text (see above for details) 

* Provides an **organized argument** (yes, even though we wrote this in parts -- the introduction and conclusion can help you organize the piece) 

* Shows **professionalism** -- i.e. that you took this assignment seriously
  * However, the annotation images can be more informal than the essay itself. If you wrote LOL or UGH in your annotation, that’s fine -- I do!
  
* Utilizes proper **mechanics**; style, sentence structure, and spelling promote coherence, clarity, and credibility
