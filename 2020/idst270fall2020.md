## Course Description

*Catalog Description*: This course introduces students to the digital humanities by raising the question of what precisely constitutes this new and emerging field. Students explore how digital media and technology have transformed multiple disciplines in the humanities as well as humanities research. Theoretical questions regarding post-humanism, privacy, print culture, copyright, and more are discussed. Students produce digital artifacts related to a field of traditional humanities study.

*Instructor's Addendum*: This version of IDST 270 will focus on texts: how we read them, how we make them, and how we design them. Throughout this course, students will experience first-hand the digital and non-digital labor required of digital humanities practitioners.

## Learning Outcomes

* Recognize, evaluate, and discuss key ideas and themes related to Digital Humanities
* Develop critical thinking and research skills
* Improve ability to communicate effectively using digital media
* Learn how to adapt to new digital technologies
