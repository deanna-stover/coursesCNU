# Course Information

## Instructor - Dr. Deanna Stover

  **email:** deanna.stover@cnu.edu 

  **office hours:** MWF 10:15 - 11:30 am, F 2:00 - 2:45 pm, and by appointment
  
   *All office hours will be held online.*
   
   Office hours are your time to come talk to me about anything related (or unrelated) to class. This time is yours, I am not (supposed to be) doing anything else; you will not be interrupting me. If you have questions about class or have other questions I might be able to answer, please (virtually) drop by.
   
   Because this is an online class, you won't be able to come up to me before and after class with questions. Because of this, email and office hours are even more important. Please make use of both.
   

## Course Description

*Catalog Description*: This course introduces students to the digital humanities by raising the question of what precisely constitutes this new and emerging field. Students explore how digital media and technology have transformed multiple disciplines in the humanities as well as humanities research. Theoretical questions regarding post-humanism, privacy, print culture, copyright, and more are discussed. Students produce digital artifacts related to a field of traditional humanities study.

*Instructor's Addendum*: This version of IDST 270 will focus on texts: how we read them, how we make them, and how we design them. Throughout this course, students will experience first-hand the digital and non-digital labor required of digital humanities practitioners.

## Learning Outcomes

* Recognize, evaluate, and discuss key ideas and themes related to Digital Humanities
* Develop critical thinking and research skills
* Improve ability to communicate effectively using digital media
* Learn how to adapt to new digital technologies

## A Note on Covid-19 and Attendance

Even though we'll be online, CNU has mandated that all online class be synchronous, so while I will have you prepare outside of class, even watching lecture videos, we will still be meeting during our allotted class time. I expect you to be there if at all possible and to sign in using Qwickly.

I want you to be in class, but I also understand that COVID-19 and everything that goes along with it (mental health, for one) are going to make this semester especially difficult. And, of course, life goes on so there is always the possibility of 2020 sending even more curve balls our way. Because of this, I won't have an attendance policy, *but* (and this is a big BUT), if you don't sign into Qwickly attendance two class days in a row, I will be checking in on you. I want to know you're okay.

And, while there's no strict attendance policy, not coming to class will likely affect your grade. We'll be discussing important topics in class and going over assignments, so without it, you may struggle. This is all to say, *please* come to class if you can. 

## Technology

Because we will be working a lot with technology, you should expect to spend time out of class familiarizing yourself with new technologies and software. 

## FERPA:

The Family Educational Records and Privacy Act gives you a right to privacy in this class. In addition to governing where I can and cannot discuss grades and to whom I can disclose information about your class participation, FERPA also implies that I cannot force you to pubically disclose that you are a student in this class.

This means that if you choose to use your real name on Twitter, you are waiving that portion of your FERPA rights and disclosing that you are a member of this class. If you would prefer to post using an alias or a handle for the tweeting portions of this course, you are protecting your right to privacy and are more than welcome to do so.

However, if you use an alias, please list your first name and last initial next to your Twitter handle in our class Google Drive so I know who you are.

## Safety Protocols Specific to COVID-19 and Academic Instruction:

Offering in-person instruction on campus requires everyone to take individual responsibility for reducing the risk of exposure for all campus community members both inside and outside the classroom.   Irresponsible behavior jeopardizes not only your own health, but also that of your fellow students, friends, professors and advisors, and members of our staff.  Therefore, you are expected to learn and diligently follow the safety protocols required by the University at all times.  The following protocols apply specifically to instructional spaces and academic buildings.

Prior to leaving their residence hall room or home, students should:
* conduct daily health screenings; and 
* pack cloth face covering(s), personal cleaning supplies, and related items for campus use.

Students cannot enter instructional spaces or academic buildings if they: 
* are experiencing symptoms of any illness, regardless of whether they believe the illness to be COVID-19;
* have been exposed to someone with COVID-19;
* are in isolation while waiting for COVID–19 test results; 
* have been directed to quarantine by a University or health department official; or
* have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and have not been approved to return to campus by a healthcare provider.

All students must adhere to the following requirements while inside instructional spaces, common areas and offices:
* attend only the classes and sections in which they are officially enrolled;
* sit in their assigned seats or work at their assigned stations every class period;
* wear a face covering at all times* (face coverings should cover the nose and mouth, be secured under the chin, and fit snugly against the sides of the face);
* use additional personal protective equipment as required for specific classes;
* maintain physical distancing of at least six feet from other people;  
* disinfect their own work areas upon arrival in and prior to departure from the instructional space; 
* refrain from sharing personal materials, such as pens, textbooks, etc., with others; 
* refrain from bringing food and drinks into the instructional space; 
* follow all directional signs; and
* follow directives regarding office hours and advising appointments.

*Students who have received an exemption from the face covering requirement for health reasons must present the proof of the exemption provided by the Office of Student Affairs to the instructor upon entering the instructional space.* 

Because non-compliance potentially endangers others, faculty members:
* are authorized to instruct anyone in non-compliance with safety protocols to correct the non-compliance or immediately leave the instructional space; and
* may submit referrals to CHECS to report non-compliance with safety protocols.

Faculty should immediately notify the Vice President for Student Affairs, Kevin Hughes (<dosa@cnu.edu> or <kmhughes@cnu.edu>), if they become aware of a student who has sought a diagnostic test or who has been exposed.  In addition, faculty members may submit referrals through the Captain’s Care Program to report absences as a way of identifying students who may have become ill.  It would be appropriate to do so when students have not attended class or communicated with the faculty member in any way for a period of one week or longer.
