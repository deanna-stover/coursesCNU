# Github/Jekyll Blog Tutorial

## What even is GitHub/Jekyll?

GitHub is a code hosting platform for versioning (meaning keeping track of changes in code) and collaboration. But that's not what we'll be using it for. We'll be using Jekyll to create a static blog with no need for a hosting service, so it is free! 

You'll be using something called [Markdown](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/lesson/1/) to write your posts. It's really quite simple! It's not coding per se, but it does convert your styling to HTML for display on your website. It takes a little patience to learn the ins and outs of Markdown, but by the end of the semester, it will be second nature!

## Before you begin . . .

. . . you will need a GitHub account. If you don't have one yet, [sign up here](https://github.com/). Remember, when you're choosing your GitHub username, keep in mind FERPA (see the statement on the syllabus) and keep it professional and appropriate. Also, keep the name as simple as you can.

## Creating your site

GitHub uses *repositories* to organize projects. You'll be creating *one* repository for your project, since this will be a blog. There's a lot you can do with the repository features in GitHub, but we'll be keeping things pretty simple.

Go to [https://github.com/new](https://github.com/new) to make your blog repository. Simply type in your repository name under "Repository Name." Again, remember FERPA when choosing your name and keep it professional, appropriate, and simple. It can even be the same name as your GitHub username!

Note that you don't want to title the repository "About Me" or anything like that since we'll be writing several blogs over the course of the semester *within* this same repository. To be clear, all of your blog posts will be hosted within this single repository, so choose the name wisely. 

Make sure your blog is public so that we can all see it.
